# In Python, Array is an object which provides a mechanism for storing several data items with only one
# identifier, thereby simplifying the task of data management. Array is beneficial if we want to store
# group of elements of the same datatype. In python, arrays can increase their size dynamically.
# real world e.g. group of students, employees etc. coding e.g. group of integer, float etc.
# Array and List are not same array can only store one type of data whereas list can have multiple datatype.
# Array uses less memory than list.

# Types of array:
# One Dimensional Array/ One D array: Single Row Multiple Columns
# e.g. students roll number(single row) 1,2,3,4,5,..(multiple columns)

# Multi Dimensional Array/ Multi D array: Multiple Row Multiple Columns
# e.g. students subjects marks
# First student mark(row1), marks: 10, 20, 30, 40, 40 (columns)

# Python does not supports multi dimensional  but we can create Multi Dimensional Array using 3rd party
# packages like numpy.
