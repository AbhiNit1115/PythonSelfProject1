# A constant is an identifier whose value can't be changes throughout the execution of a program whereas
# the variable values keep on changing.
# There are no constants in python the way they exists in C and JAVA. In Python it is not possible to define
# constant whose value can't be changed.
# In Python constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores
# separating words but remember its value can be changed.
