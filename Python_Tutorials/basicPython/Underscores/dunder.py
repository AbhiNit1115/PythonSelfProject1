# Double underscores are often referred to as “dunders” in the Python community. For example, you’d
# pronounce __baz as “dunder baz”. Likewise __init__ would be pronounced as “dunder init”, even though one might
# think it should be “dunder init dunder.” But that’s just yet another quirk in the naming convention. It’s like
# a secret handshake for Python developers.
