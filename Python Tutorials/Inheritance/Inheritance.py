# All classes in python are build from a single super class called "object", so whenever we create
# a class in python, object will become super class for them internally
# we usually create class like this:
# class Mobile:
# but internally its happening like
# class Mobile(object):
# This object we don't need to explicitly specify
# Types of Inheritance : Single, Multi-Level, Multiple, Hierarchical etc.
