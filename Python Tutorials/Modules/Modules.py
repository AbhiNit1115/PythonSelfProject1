# A module is a file containing python definitions and statements
# A module is a file containing group of variables, methods, functions, classes etc.
# They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement.
# The file name is the module name with suffix .py appended
# e.g. mymodule.py
# Two types of modules a.) user defined b.) built-in module(array, math etc.)
# Module Usage: In large project its very difficult to manage all logic in one single file, so in order to
# separate similar logic(s) into a separate file(s) we use modules makes code clean and helps in debugging.
# Import statement is use to import modules. Syntax's: import module_name
# import nodule_name as alias_name
# from module_name import func1,func2....funcN
# from module_name import var1, var2....varN
# From module_name import class1, class2,....classN
# from module_name import * --> this will import everything from module
# We can use module name to access the methods, functions, variables, classes
# e.g. module_name.function_name()/class_name/method_name()
